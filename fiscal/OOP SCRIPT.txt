Problem:
Many Filipinos struggle to achieve 
financial independence due to limited financial literacy, 
insufficient resources for tracking income and expenses, and 
outdated government financial information. A significant portion 
of the population lacks foundational knowledge about budgeting, savings, 
and debt management, leading to paycheck-to-paycheck living, inadequate 
savings, and debt mismanagement. Despite available tools, the lack of accessible, 
updated financial information combined with time constraints makes it challenging 
for individuals to form good financial habits and understand essential aspects of their 
finances, such as tax regulations and economic planning.

Purpose/Solution:
Fiscal Harmony aims to address these issues by offering a comprehensive personal 
finance management tool that empowers Filipinos to improve financial literacy, 
build healthy financial habits, and take control of their finances. The app combines 
a detailed budgeting tool, income and expense tracking, and an emergency fund calculator, 
all designed to promote responsible financial management. Fiscal Harmony also provides 
updated financial insights and educational resources, enabling users to make informed 
decisions and plan for long-term financial stability. By bridging the financial literacy gap, 
Fiscal Harmony supports users on their journey to financial independence and economic well-being.
